# groupProj-DroneBucket



During my time at Coding Dojo, I had the amazing opportunity to collaborate with a team in developing a distinctive project. We collectively decided to tackle the creation of a comprehensive CRUD application, enabling users to upload photos along with their titles and descriptions. This incredible team and I effectively applied our newly acquired knowledge of the MERN stack to construct a mongoose database, and using React as the front end. Additionally, I successfully implemented my understanding of Framer Motion to enhance the frontend code, incorporating unique styling elements. Moreover, I successfully integrated Multer on the backend to ensure seamless photo uploads, storage, and display on the frontend. I am excited to work on future personal or professional projects, leveraging this expertise.
